# SW_DnD_simulator

INSTALLATION:
pip install -r requirements.txt

It's a simple simulator for my own rpg based on a star wars lore and a D&D game rules (mostly 5ed and 3.5).
It can be easly converted into a D&D 5th edition simulator if you upload weapons from it, classes etc.
I plan to do it in a future though, so you may want to wait if that's what are you looking for.

This is purely a hobby project so please Disney and Wizards of the Coast don't sue me.
